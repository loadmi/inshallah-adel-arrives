          Hi, I'm <a href="https://github.com/loadmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loadmi</a>. 
          I'm a developer who enjoys building tools that solve (sometimes very specific) problems.

        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Inshallah Adel Arrives</strong> is a data-driven attempt to predict the arrival time of a very specific individual: Adel.
        </p>
        <p>
          We made this because Adel's punctuality is... legendary. Traditional calendars and clocks failed us, 
          so we turned to machine learning. By tracking historical arrival data, we aim to provide a more 
          realistic expectation of when he might actually show up.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's part joke, part serious data science project, and entirely necessary for our sanity.
